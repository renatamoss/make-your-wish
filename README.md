# make_your_wish

This is a project developed in Vue JS - with Option API* -  using Rest Json-Server APIs, hosted on the HEROKU platform. Consuming data with Vuex and Axios authentication. Crud with create, read, update and delete request functionality. SASS-style web application.

*Option API - If we compare the application structures of both, we will definitely notice that the Composition API provides simpler, cleaner, and more readable code for the application structure. With the Options API, there are things such as the lifecycle hooks that can make the code less readable.
